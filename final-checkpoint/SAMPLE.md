## Idea
Medicinal Plant Identification with Machine Learning.

## Description
Integrating machine learning in medicinal plant detection offers numerous benefits and applications. It enables rapid screening of plant samples, identification of potential bioactive compounds, and prediction of therapeutic properties. Additionally, it facilitates the discovery of new plant-based drugs, optimization of cultivation practices, and conservation of endangered plant species. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we can unlock the full potential of medicinal plants for human health and well-being.
